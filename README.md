#  Argument Buffers

This is a conversion of Apple sample code for "Rendering reflections in real time using ray tracing".

You can download Apple sample code from: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Metal/rendering-reflections-in-real-time-using-ray-tracing


I have converted the project to Swift and Xcode 26.
I have removed all ray tracing and post processing, as I was just interested in the instancing and argument buffers.
